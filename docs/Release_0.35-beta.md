## Installing and running the Wallet GUI

1. Downloading the wallet
 
   Download file [ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar](https://github.com/vaklinov/zcash-swing-wallet-ui/releases/download/0.35-beta/ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar)
   and place it in a folder like `~/Downloads`. Then please make the JAR executable with a command like:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ chmod u+x ./ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar
   ```
   
2. Verifying the download

   **This step is very important!** To verify that the file `ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar` is an authentic release, you
   need to compute its SHA256 checksum, like this:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ sha256sum ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar 
   921fa5b7113ead17882104046f8ad2b6132f678db9d05e0454bf416f0980a210  ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar
   ```
   **If the resulting checksum is not `921fa5b7113ead17882104046f8ad2b6132f678db9d05e0454bf416f0980a210` then**
   **something is wrong and you should discard the downloaded wallet!**

3. Installing the downloaded ZCash GUI wallet

  3.1. If you have built ZCash from source code:

   Assuming you have already built from source code [ZCash](https://z.cash/) in directory `/home/user/zcash/src` (for 
   example - this is the typical build dir. for ZCash v1.0.0) which contains the command line tools `zen-cli` 
   and `zend` you need to take the file `ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar` and copy it 
   to diretcory `/home/user/zcash/src` (the same dir. that contains `zen-cli` and `zend`). Example copy command:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ cp ./ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar /home/user/zcash/src    
   ```
   
  3.2. If you have installed the ZCash [binary packages](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/wiki/Debian-binary-packages)

   The command line tools `zen-cli` and `zend` are placed by the package installer in:
   ```
   /usr/bin/zen-cli
   /usr/bin/zend
   ```
   The ZCash GUI wallet knows how to find them there. You may place the file  `ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar`
   anywhere in your `/home` directory that you find convenient and start it from there.

4. Running the installed ZCash GUI wallet

   Before running the GUI you need to start zend (e.g. `zend --daemon`). The wallet GUI is a Java program packaged 
   as an executable JAR file. It may be run from command line or started from another GUI tool (e.g. file manager). 
   Assuming you have already installed [ZCash](https://z.cash/) and the GUI Wallet `ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar` in 
   directory `/home/user/zcash/src` one way to run it from command line is:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~$ java -jar /home/user/zcash/src/ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar
   ```
   If you are using Ubuntu (or similar ;) Linux you may instead just use the file manager and 
   right-click on the `ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar` file and choose the option "Open with OpenJDK 8 Runtime". 
   This will start the ZCash GUI wallet.

### Known issues and limitations

1. Limitation: Wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in ZCash due to stability problems. A corresponding issue 
[#1552](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1552) has been opened by the ZCash developers. Correspondingly
wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in the ZCash Desktop GUI Wallet.
1. Issue: the GUI wallet does not work correctly if zend is started with a custom data directory, like:
`zend -datadir=/home/data/whatever` This will be fixed in later versions.
1. Issue: GUI data tables (transactions/addresses etc.) allow copying of data via double click but also allow editing. 
The latter needs to be disabled. 
1. Limitation: The list of transactions does not show all outgoing ones (specifically outgoing Z address 
transactions). A corresponding issue [#1438](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1438) has been opened 
for the ZCash developers - soon to be fixed. A fix for the GUI wallet may be expected within 1-2 weeks. 
1. Limitation: The CPU percentage shown to be taken by zend is the average for the entire lifetime of the process. 
This is not very useful. This will be improved in future versions.
